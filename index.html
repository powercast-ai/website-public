                    <div>With backgrounds in data science, data engineering and the energy industry, our team came together to build powercast.ai because we recognized a shift in technology, enabling a transformation of the way power forecasting can be developed, managed and delivered.</div>
                    <div>A shift away from rigid legacy company structures, traditional regression analysis as the only tool in the toolbox, local physical hardware, software installation requirements, and cumbersome data integration processes.</div>
                    <div>Towards decentralization, exploitation of artificial intelligence, security, consistency, flexibility, and a user-focused approach.</div>
                    <div>The technological shift was primarily driven by 3 key advancements. First, improvements in compute capability; itâ€™s simply become easier to crunch a lot of data. Second, availability of cloud-based IT architecture, making it possible to build a very flexible, robust and secure platform for structuring and managing data. And third, a proliferation of data availability, especially within the area of weather data, which can be taken advantage of through careful and deliberate data engineering and a high level of domain knowledge.</div>
                    <div>We are data and energy forecasting specialists, who strive not only to capture the complexity of the demand and supply side of electricity systems - but also to make this business-critical data easily accessible and digestible.</div>

                    <p class="normal-text-skyblue">All forecasts express an average MW value for each settlement period and are generated at national level for the GB market.</p>
                    <p class="normal-text-skyblue">The time horizon covers the short-term trading cycle, optimized for trading in the intraday and day-ahead trading windows.</p>

                    <p class="hightlight">Demand</p>
                    <p class="normal-text-3">The national demand forecast includes transmission losses, but excludes interconnector flows and demand from station transformers and pumped storage units. As such, it is a standardized data point which can be directly interpreted and compared to standardized industry and public data, such as the Initial National Demand Out-turn (INDO) and National Demand Forecast (NDF) from the National Energy System Operator (NESO).</p>

Both individual embedded generation forecasts are used as data input for the national demand forecast.</p>

                <div class="products-description">
                    <p class="hightlight">Embedded Wind</p>
                    <p class="normal-text-3">The national embedded wind generation forecast estimates electricity output generated from wind turbines connected to the distribution grid. This generation does not have transmission system metering installed and is therefore often considered "invisible". The effect of embedded generation is a suppression of demand at the level of the transmission grid.</p>
