                        <div>With backgrounds in data science, data engineering and the energy industry, our team came together to build powercast.ai because we recognized a shift in technology, enabling a transformation of the way power forecasting can be developed, managed and delivered.</div>
                        <div>A shift away from rigid legacy company structures, traditional regression analysis as the only tool in the toolbox, local physical hardware, software installation requirements, and cumbersome data integration processes.</div>
                        <div>Towards decentralization, exploitation of artificial intelligence, security, consistency, flexibility, and a user-focused approach.</div>
                        <div>The technological shift was primarily driven by 3 key advancements. First, improvements in compute capability; itâ€™s simply become easier to crunch a lot of data. Second, availability of cloud-based IT architecture, making it possible to build a very flexible, robust and secure platform for structuring and managing data. And third, a proliferation of data availability, especially within the area of weather data, which can be taken advantage of through careful and deliberate data engineering and a high level of domain knowledge.</div>
                        <div>We are data and energy forecasting specialists, who strive not only to capture the complexity of the demand and supply side of electricity systems - but also to make this business-critical data easily accessible and digestible.</div>

This generation does not have transmission system metering installed and is therefore often considered "invisible". The effect of embedded generation is a suppression of demand at the level of the transmission grid.</p>
